# Introduction
## What is Machine Learing
### Machine Learning difinition:  
• ArthurSamuel(1959).MachineLearning:Fieldof study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
• TomMitchell(1998)Well-posedLearning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

## Supervised Learning (教師あり学習)
right answers given
Regression (回帰):Predict continuous valued output
統計学において、Y が連続値の時にデータに Y = f(X) というモデル(「定量的な関係の構造」)を当てはめる事。
